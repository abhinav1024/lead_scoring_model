# Lead Scoring Model

## Business Problem Statement
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. The company gets a lot of leads, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate of the company is around 30%. 
To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’. If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.

## Business Objective
The business objective of this case study is to identify the most promising leads , that is the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers for the X Education company. We need to build a model and assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher chance of conversion than the customers with a lower lead score. The ballpark target given by the company’s CEO is to get the lead conversion rate to be around 80%
